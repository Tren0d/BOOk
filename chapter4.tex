\chapter{Games}

In the olympiads usually we only considered games with ''complete information''. That means that every player (if there are multiple ones) knows fully what he (and other players) can do at any moment of time, so there is no hidden cards or random events. Some examples of such games are chess, tic-tac-toe and checkers.
